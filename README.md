# Necrobot / MobBot Visualizer Chrome Verson

Clone necrobotvisualizer from https://github.com/nicoschmitt/necrobotvisualizer
Clone gmaps from http://github.com/HPNeo/gmaps

You have to be up to date on the bot side (master or maybe latest release).  
In the Visualizer, the url on the config page should match the port you configured on bot side (both have the same default).

## Installer

Go to the release tab, grab the latest and just launch it.

## Config

Click on the small settings icon on the bottom right of the app.  
The important thing is websocket url and port. Default is also bot default so it should just work.  
You can also choose local for Pokemon name display.

## Run from Code
 1. Download Zip.
 2. Double Chick Index.html
