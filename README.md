# Necrobot / MobBot Visualizer Chrome Verson

Clone necrobotvisualizer from https://github.com/nicoschmitt/necrobotvisualizer

You have to be up to date on the bot side (master or maybe latest release).  
In the Visualizer, the url on the config page should match the port you configured on bot side (both have the same default).

## Install 
   Select Download as zip and decompress zip file.

## Config

Click on the small settings icon on the bottom right of the app.  
The important thing is websocket url and port. Default is also bot default so it should just work.  
You can also choose local for Pokemon name display.

## Run from Code
 1. Turn on Websocket on Necrobot.
 2. Double Chick Index.html
